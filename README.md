The goal of this script was to run through a list of logs from a chat client and categorise the results, we had been using various techniques in an effort to streamline the process, so that we could feed them into an internal machine learning algorithms as training data for our suite of tools
Using machine learning methods was incredibly useful and yielded results very fast, however it also made many mistakes, which in turn made it more complicated for my colleague’s and myself, whilst learning Python3 I created this very simple script to run through and attempt to categorise  the logs using the training file, anything that proved to be “noise”, such as one word logs or nonsense should be removed (into its own bucket) and NOT included in the good data, anything not considered “noise” but also not recognised should not be discounted either, as it can be used to recognise more category’s and tighten the training.
